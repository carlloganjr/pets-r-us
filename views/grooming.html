        Grooming takes time, effort, and a certain amount of patience for 
        pets that donâ€™t want to be groomed. Here at Pets-R-Us, we have the 
        time, effort, and patience to ensure your pet receives the proper 
        grooming.  We will also take other steps to help maintain your pet's 
        health by thoroughly checking them as we groom them. This provides a 
        great overview of your pet that can detect any possible health 
        problems before they become real problems. By scheduling regular 
        appointments, our team will come to know your pet and understand if 
        anything is wrong during grooming services. By choosing Pet-R-Us you 
        are choosing to show your pet more love through extra attention from 
        our grooming team. Not only is grooming a great way to keep your pet 
        healthy but it can also reduce stress on you and your pet. Grooming 
        can give your pet the extra petting and attention they desire. Being 
        brushed will provide your pet with a spa-like treatment and they will 
        be in a world of bliss, making them look forward to coming back. So, 
        take the time to

        Treating your pet is like treating yourself to something special. 
        Once your pet arrives, our team will parade them through the lobby 
        where a crowd of pet lovers and other pets will greet them with a 
        joyful shout. Afterward, they will receive a signature Pets-R-Us 
        <b>Pampered Pet Treat Sundae</b> made by a local veterinarian to include all the 
        nutrients your pet needs. Finally, your pet will be taken to their 
        own private room for grooming.
