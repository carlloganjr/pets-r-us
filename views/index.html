        The reasons are obvious why pets prefer Pets-R-Us for grooming, 
        boarding, and training. Treating your pet like a celebrity means 
        they never want to leave, and they always want to come back. We 
        value them as the wonderful customers they are while treating 
        them to quality services while you are away. Every pet through the 
        door receives a complimentary swag bag full of goodies for later 
        enjoyment. Once the first appointment is made, you will be assigned 
        a pet concierge to ensure they are well taken care of throughout 
        their appointments. Here at Pets-R-Us we care for pets and hope it 
        shows with the afterglow of receiving our services.

        Pet-R-Us grooming services helped my pet maintain a healthy sheen
        on their coat, something I had a problem doing on my own.

      <blockquote class="wordy words"><!-- Start Pete Testimonial -->
        Without Pets-R-Us I would not have such a well trained pet. The 
        training services provided me with a pet that behaves great in every
        situation.
